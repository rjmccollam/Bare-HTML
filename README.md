##HTML Development Files

A starting point for HTML and CSS projects. Typically I use this as a starting point for my WordPress builds so the CSS has some WordPress styles and bloginfo already in it.

###Sass
This starter bundle uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. Personally I use a mac app Codekit which will handle .scss files very easily. If you use Codekit as well you will need to set an output path for your regular style.css. You should set your output path to be the root of your project folder, if you chose not to do that make sure to update the href for the stylesheet in the head.
